# Passion For Cars

Passion for cars is a site that aims to attract more people into the car community and serves as a platform for existing car enthusiasts. The target audience is very broad , ranging from kids up to adults of roughly 45 years of age. The site offers a quick insight into the history of the automobile with links that can lead a user to read far beyond just the history, and the possibility to get emails sent about upcoming events depending on the users preference where they can meet other car enthusiasts.

## Features
- __Navigation Bar__
  
  - The navigation bar at the top of the website that stays the same across all 3 pages and contains the name of the website in the top left corner,
  which when clicked brings you back to the top of the home page.

- __Header__
  - The header in the top left corner shows the name of the website and is clear what this site is supporting/who it is for.
  - The colour used is a hexadecimal with the value #D7A000
  - I chose this colour as it stands out and doesn't blend in to the background colour.

- __Menu__
  - The menu elements follow the same layout, are fully responsive across the 3 pages and adjust depending on the width of the viewport screen.
  - When the screen width goes below 900px the menu elements float left and go under the header.
  - The purpose if this navigation is to allow users to navigate the site easily and clearly.
  - Upon hovering the elements in the menu currently being hovered will change colour to aqua, indicating what the user will select.
  - Additionally the menu has a style added which underlines the current page name the user is on in the menu section.
        
   
   
 - __Landing page image__

   - The landing page has a main image that pops out immediately upon loading to allow the user to see they are on a car site.
   - This image seemed very eye catching to me and aims to attract the attention of anyone who visits the site.

- __History section__
   - The history section is designed to give the user a snippet of the history of cars and have them interested to learn more. 
   - Existing car enthusiasts may not have known some of the history either so it will be something new for a large majority of users.
   - Clickable links that open up in new browser tabs exist in this section.
   - The first being "History of cars " heading and a link to Nicholas Joseph Cugnot (inventor of the first automobile that could carry passengers).
   - 
   ### History section Images
   - The images are of a Ford Model T and Volkswagen Beetle cars and are shown because the history paragraph mentions these vehicles as the most mass produced vehicles ever.
   - The images help the user get a clear image of the vehicles without the need to go search for them if they are not aware of these cars.
   - The images are also responsive depending on the width of the viewport , on medium devices they go under the paragraph and on small devices one image goes under the other.
